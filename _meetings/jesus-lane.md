Tea and coffee follows Meeting for Worship, as well as other regular activities which you are welcome to stay for

- **Local Meeting for Business** is held on the first Sunday of each months (except January and August)
- **Singing Together** takes place at 1200 on the third Sunday of each month
- Also on third Sundays we have a **bring-and-share lunch**.

We also have a **Meeting for Worship on Wednesdays** from 1315-1345, preceded most weeks by a Soup and Cheese lunch at 1230.

We also have monthly **Evening Meetings for Worship** at the Meeting House, in which we explore different topics.

### History of Jesus Lane Meeting

Quakers first held meetings
in Jesus Lane in the 1650s. Parts of the
present Meeting House date from 1777 and
there have been additions and rebuildings
at various times in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries.

Today, Friends still meet each Sunday and
Wednesday for worship based in silence.

We warmly welcome anyone who feels
drawn to experiencing Quaker worship.
