Meeting for Worship is held every Sunday from 10.30 to 11.30 a.m, and on Wednesday evenings from 7.00-7.45pm, and we always welcome visitors.

Children are welcome every Sunday; a Children’s Meeting is organised for the second Sunday of each month and all children are welcome. If you have children who would like to come with you, on other Sundays it would helpful (but not necessary) to let us know beforehand.

## Location

{% include image.html class='thumbnail-left' src='/img-site/peterborough/peterborough-front-small.jpg' %}

Peterborough Quaker Meeting House is next to Crescent Bridge, just west of the Railway on River Lane (the old continuation of Thorpe Road, from before the bridge was built). Both the bus and railway stations are within 5 mins walk, and there is plenty of car & cycle parking in front.

## Our Meetings for Worship

Meeting for Worship is held each Sunday morning and Wednesday evening.  In the main meeting room chairs are set out in a circle with a table in the middle. Please sit anywhere you like.

Quaker Meeting for Worship starts as soon as the first person sits down. Latecomers enter quietly and take their seats.

On the table there are usually flowers and some Bibles, as well as a copy of Quaker Faith and Practice.
During Meeting for Worship we sit together in silence, which is sometimes broken by spoken ministry, which anyone who feels moved is free to make, although we usually allow a time of reflection between contributions.

Finally, Elders will shake hands marking the end and after which we all join hands in a circle. Meeting has now ended and it is time for notices, news and finally simple refreshments together. If you are attending for the first time you may be invited to introduce yourself and sign our Visitors Book, but neither is obligatory.

If you want to know more, you will always be welcome to speak to any Quaker, especially over tea or coffee after Meeting.
A variety of leaflets about all aspects of Quakerism are stocked in the welcome area. Please feel free to take some with you. We also have a small library where books are available to borrow.
