Oast House Meeting continues to meet a need for a small, quiet Meeting for Worship (with typically six or seven Friends present), where those attending can get to know each other well, both on a personal level and more deeply. It is our hope that our occasional visitors and new attenders also find us friendly and welcoming.

We meet in the Outer Parlour of Pembroke College on Sundays from 1030-1130am. Once a month we also hold discussion groups.

The Meeting has no children’s class, and any children attending remain in the care of the adults who bring them.

Disabled access to the Outer Parlour, where Meeting is held, is possible, and there are toilets on the same level nearby, though not specially adapted.
